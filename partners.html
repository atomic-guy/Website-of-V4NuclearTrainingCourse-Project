                                        <p>The Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering (FNSPE) was
                                            established in 1955, and at that time its primary mission was to train new
                                            experts with a strong theoretical background for the emerging Czechoslovak
                                            nuclear programme. Gradually, however, its responsibilities were extended to
                                            cover a wider scope of fields and courses in mathematics, physics and
                                            chemistry so that, in keeping with its tradition, it can now offer excellent
                                            education with a personal approach to students' tuition. Faculty provides
                                            courses in the branch of nuclear engineering - focused on
                                            theoretical and experimental reactor physics, neutron applications, nuclear
                                            reactor operation and engineering. The Faculty operates Training reactor
                                            VR-1, lightwater zero power fission reactor, and also fusion reactor Golem.
